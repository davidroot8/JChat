They made their way towards the net and started to gather other people to play. Jake went one way on the beach, while Marvin went the other. They each talked to people as they worked their way down the beach and found two full teams of players. Once everyone made it back to the net, they began to hit the ball back and forth while laughing and talking. The sun was at the top of the sky beaming down on them, and its rays reflected out of many pairs of sunglasses. \n\nThe temperature continued to climb as the group played. After half an hour, Marvin noticed that something was off. Every player was sweating profusely, and the game slowed significantly. Marvin checked the temperature on his phone, he was bewildered by what he saw. The weather app stated that it was 120Â°F, and there was a severe weather alert. Before he could say anything to the group, the sun began to grow brighter and brighter. Everyone was blinded, and they tried to shield their eyes. The sun then exploded in a burst of color, and Jake woke up with a jolt. He was sweating in his bed, it was all just a dream. Relieved, he turned over and went back to sleep.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"},

When you complete the practice for that day, place a sticker in the box.

Start planning easy and tasty side dishes for your dinners and veggie-focused lunches. Remember, there are options for eating vegetables that aren't raw salads. Consider having roasted vegetables like zucchini instead of roasted potatoes for dinner. Juices and smoothies are also underrated options for consuming your fruits and vegetables. One half-cup of orange juice (4 US fl. oz.) is equal to one serving of fruit. This means you can knock out two servings of fruit with just one cup of OJ in the morning.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Chat"},

There had not been an agreement on their demands for fair compensation, and the members voted to strike. For 99 days, writers of America stood strong in a striking demonstration of what workers can do to create equity in the workplace. Now, with inflation and interest rates rising without wages increasing, we see the possibility of another strike on the horizon. \n\nWGA's history of protesting seems to garner more and more attention each time it happens. After all, entertainment in America rests on those who write it. With innovations in broadcast television, streaming, and cinema, Americans have access to content created by writers who belong to WGA more now than ever before. While the possibility of another strike in times of economic strife may seem daunting to some, the historical credence of solidarity is a consistent guiding flame.  \n\nSome demands that may be featured in future talks with Hollywood's executive class include provisions for healthcare, the preservation of writers' rooms, and the restriction of AI-generated content. While the first two issues have been known to be a large part of past protests, artificial intelligence is certainly a newer and larger challenge.\n\nIt's black and white the reasons why writers are a backbone of society, and the moral compass of one's right to strike always points as a guidance for action.","role":"assistant"}],"category":"Generation"},
