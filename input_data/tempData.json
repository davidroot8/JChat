        "assistant_response": "Sure! Here are five options for things to do in London on a rainy day:\n\n1. Visit The British Museum. Dedicated to human history, art and culture, The British Museum has over 8 million permanent objects in its collection and is spread over multiple floors and wings of its impressive Bloomsbury building. From its extensive collection of Egyptian mummies to the Rosetta Stone, there are numerous exhibitions to capture your imagination. The museum is free to enjoy, though runs separately ticketed exhibitions throughout the year, as well. \n\n2. Explore Spitalfields Market. Since the 17th century, traders have been operating out of this East London market selling food, art, antiques, jewellery, and so much more. Today, the covered market is a hot destination for fashion and food enthusiasts with numerous stalls and shops open every day of the week. On the weekends, the market hosts various community events including pop-up music festivals. \n\n3. Shop at Westfield London. Located in West London, Westfield London is an enormous shopping centre hosting roughly 320 stores and restaurants spread over 2.5 million square feet, including the high-end retail sector named The Village. In addition to a wide selection of food and shopping, there are multiple activity options including miniature golf, rock climbing, and a cinema. \n\n4. Visit the Barbican Centre. The Barbican Centre is a large performing arts centre in the City of London nestled in the impressive Barbican Estate, which is an impressive example of Brutalist architecture. The centre is home to both the London Symphony Orchestra and the BBC Symphony Orchestra, in addition to hosting multiple theatre performances, film screenings, and additional concerts. The public are also welcome to enjoy its library, dine in one of its three restaurants, or explore its vast indoor conservatory. \n\n5. Explore the Battersea Power Station. The Grade-II listed Battersea Power Station, which sits on the south bank of the Thames just west of Westminster, was recently refurbished and reopened as a shopping and leisure destination. Inside the building, there are various shops, eateries, and bard including Control Room B: a cocktail bar nestled within the original dials and controls of the power station. If there's a break in the rainy weather, the riverfront of the power station is lined with additional food stalls, and Battersea Park is a short five-minute walk away down the bank of the Thames. If the rain stays all day, though, there are plenty of activities sheltered by the power station including miniature gold, ping pong, and a cinema. \n\nWhether it's rain or shine, London has an endless supply of activities, sights, and eateries to ensure you have an unforgettable trip.

The music genre known as pirate metal is a unique blend of heavy metal and sea shanties, accompanied by folk instruments like the concertina. Despite the unusual mix, bands such as Alestorm have found success in this genre and have a dedicated following.\n2. Math rock is an indie rock style that utilizes complex time signatures and unusual meters. The genre emerged in the 1980s and peaked in the mid-1990s. Today, similar techniques have been adapted to pop music, resulting in the creation of the genre known as \"math pop.\"\n3. Steven Roden created the minimalist ambient music genre called \"lowercase\" in 2001 by manipulating and amplifying sounds made from handling paper. The genre is characterized by its quiet and unobtrusive nature and gained attention following the release of the compilation album \"Lowercase-Sound\" in 2002. Roden's track \"Bell Is The Truth (Berlin)\" exemplifies the beauty of the genre, created by tapping light bulbs in total darkness to produce bell-like sounds.\n4. Witch House is a genre that doesn't have any resemblance to house music, despite the name. It was coined by Travis Egedy (aka, Pictureplane) and features slow tempo, chopped and screwed songs with elements of goth, shoegaze, hip-hop, drone, noise, and industrial. Other artists, such as Clams Casino, Holy Other, and Zola Jesus, have also incorporated Witch House elements into their music. Though the genre burned out after a few years, it remains captivating.\n5. Skweee is a genre of mostly instrumental music that originated in Sweden and Finland, combining synth leads and basslines with funk and soul rhythms. Its name reflects the idea of squeezing out the grooviest sound possible. Skweee was also a major influence on dubstep during 2008-2009.",

Due to its size, it took centuries to build. It was worked on several different times between 300 BC and 700 AD. There was a temple above it to worship Quetzalcoatl - the Aztec god of learning and books. However, the temple was abandoned around the 8th or 9th century AD. Over time, it became covered with vegetation. As a result, it blended in and Spaniards first mistook it for a hill when they conquered Mexico in 1521. They replaced the temple with a church and the pyramid stayed hidden until the 1930s when the earth started to erode. Archeologists have excavated and studied many parts of the pyramid since then, including the altars. It has also become a tourist attraction since then.

You remember those, like The Hollywood Squares, Donny & Marie, The Sonny and Cher Show, and The Brady Bunch Hour? But after I left Ike, I started getting sued for all these gigs that we'd had to cancel. I had to resume touring with United Artists just to pay off my debts, but thanks to Bob Mackie I came back sexier than ever in 77! My career really took off, from cabaret shows in Vegas to tours across the US and Australia.  \n\nRough, my third solo album, came out in 1978 and was distributed across the U.S. and Europe! And then there was my next album, Love Explosion, which was my exploration into disco. Unfortunately, neither of these performed very well, so I ended up leaving United Artists. I still got to headline another tour, at least.\n\nin 1979, I ran into an Australian manager named Roger Davies. After he saw me perform in San Francisco at the Fairmont Hotel, he agreed to be my manager! I was back in the international spotlight, working in Italy on Luna Park and touring in South Africa. That move of mine got a lot of flack, and to tell you the truth, I regret my naivety about the apartheid. \n\nFlash forward to October 1981, when Rod Stewart saw me perform in New York City and invited me to perform on Saturday Night Live with him. The next month, I opened for the Rolling Stones on their American Tour. Early the next year, I got to perform on the Willem Ruis show in the Netherlands, and my song \"Shame, Shame, Shame,\" ended up being a hit. My cover of \"Ball of Confusion\" (that I recorded for B.E.F.) was really popular in European dance clubs. I even got to film an MTV music video for that song. I was one of the first black American artists on the channel. I also got to appear on Chuck Berry's television special that year. The rest, as they say, is history!\n\nSincerely, \nTina Turner",

Watch Japanese TV shows and movies: Watching Japanese TV shows and movies can help you improve your listening and comprehension skills. Try to watch them without subtitles for an added challenge.\n\n7. Immerse yourself in the language: Finally, immerse yourself in Japanese culture as much as possible. Listen to Japanese music, read Japanese books, and practice speaking and writing as often as possible.\n\n8. Seek feedback: Find a tutor or language exchange partner who can provide feedback on your writing and speaking skills.

Use the text following this request. \n\nAfter World War II, designating the start and end dates for daylight saving time fell to state governments. Because this created many railroad scheduling and safety problems, however, Congress passed the Uniform Time Act in 1966. This law set the nationwide dates of daylight saving time from the last Sunday in April until the last Sunday in October. In 2007, Congress amended the act to expand the period in which daylight saving time is in effect from the second Sunday in March to the first Sunday in November - dates that remain in effect today.\n\nThe Uniform Time Act allows states and territories to opt out of daylight saving time, however. Arizona and Hawaii are on permanent standard time, along with Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, Guam and American Samoa.\n\nNow, many other states are considering whether to stop falling back and springing ahead. Several U.S. states have legislation and resolutions under consideration to support permanent standard time, while many others have been or are considering permanent daylight saving time. Legislation and resolutions for permanent standard time have increased from 15% in 2021 to 31% in 2023.\n\nIn March 2022, the U.S. Senate passed the Sunshine Protection Act  in a bid to make daylight saving time permanent. But the House did not move forward with this legislation. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio reintroduced the bill on March 1, 2023.\n\nThe spike in activity among states seeking to break from these twice-yearly changes reflects how more people are recognizing the downsides of this practice. Now, it's up to legislators to decide whether we end the time shift altogether, and to choose permanent standard or daylight saving time.",
        "assistant_response": "After WWII, states were given the right to choose the start and end dates for daylight saving time, but this caused serious problems for rail schedules. To address this, Congress passed the Uniform Time Act in 1966 which standardized the changes, but still allowed states and territories to opt out entirely. Arizona, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and some U.S. territories decided to stay on permanent time. \n\nMany other states and legislators are considering abolishing daylight saving time, but no bill has passed. People are starting to recognize the problems caused by changing the time twice a year and want to move to a permanent standard time. ",

        "assistant_response": "Certainly! The function 'checkForEvens' iterates through an array and if a number in the array is divisible by 2, then it gets added to 'answer' which is later returned.\n\nThe reason the function may not be returning the expected result is because of the if statement, 'if (nums[i] /2 == 0)'. The statement is looking for numbers that get divided by 2 in the array and equal 0, which doesn't align with what you expect the function to do. \n\nInstead, you want to use the modulo operator to check for the remainder of a number that is being divided by 2. If a number is divided by 2 and returns a remainder of 0, then we can assume that it's an even number.

Everyone says it's not that serious right now but it seems like it is to me, I don't want to fall behind right away.  I'm supposed to pick based on my interests and whatnot, but my only interests are video games and anime cartoon shows.  I can't seem to come up with anything solid based on those.  One thing I have always been good at is photography, people are always complimenting my photos online.  Could you help me think of some possible majors that I'm not going to hate and aren't going to make me poor forever?",

As such, people have adopted remote setups like home offices and online classrooms worldwide. And with the growing demand for online education, the number of online courses and degrees has likewise increased.\n\nWith the new normal, DepEd designed the Basic Education-Learning Continuity Plan. This plan aims to ensure the safety of students, teachers, and staff. It also intends to give quality distance learning by using self-learning modules. These can be accessed through digital forms, radio, TV, and online platforms.\n\nOnline classes are flexible learning tools widely used in the Philippines. They are vital because of the following:\n\nLessons can be delivered efficiently through technology.\nLessons and students' progress can be easily monitored and recorded.\nStudents and teachers can interact even if they are not physically present in the same room. They can also participate in conferences in other countries without actually going there.\nRich and poor students can receive the same high-quality online education at an affordable price.\nIndeed, technology is an important part of education. It links students to their teachers amid lockdowns and community quarantine. For this reason, Childhope brings its Alternative Education sessions online. It aims to serve marginalized street children and youth. Thus, more than 300 of its beneficiaries can attend classes online.\"",
