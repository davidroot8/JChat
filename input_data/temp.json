"Write a multiple-choice quiz about the Importance of Online Learning, please make the article below as the basis of questions.\n\n\"The pandemic has forced everyone to continue having a normal life while staying at home. As such, people have adopted remote setups like home offices and online classrooms worldwide. And with the growing demand for online education, the number of online courses and degrees has likewise increased.\n\nWith the new normal, DepEd designed the Basic Education-Learning Continuity Plan. This plan aims to ensure the safety of students, teachers, and staff. It also intends to give quality distance learning by using self-learning modules. These can be accessed through digital forms, radio, TV, and online platforms.\n\nOnline classes are flexible learning tools widely used in the Philippines. They are vital because of the following:\n\nLessons can be delivered efficiently through technology.\nLessons and students' progress can be easily monitored and recorded.\nStudents and teachers can interact even if they are not physically present in the same room. They can also participate in conferences in other countries without actually going there.\nRich and poor students can receive the same high-quality online education at an affordable price.\nIndeed, technology is an important part of education. It links students to their teachers amid lockdowns and community quarantine. For this reason, Childhope brings its Alternative Education sessions online. It aims to serve marginalized street children and youth. Thus, more than 300 of its beneficiaries can attend classes online.\"
