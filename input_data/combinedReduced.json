    "assistant_response": "Sure! Here are five options for things to do in London on a rainy day:\n\n1. Visit The British Museum. Dedicated to human history, art and culture, The British Museum has over 8 million permanent objects in its collection and is spread over multiple floors and wings of its impressive Bloomsbury building. From its extensive collection of Egyptian mummies to the Rosetta Stone, there are numerous exhibitions to capture your imagination. The museum is free to enjoy, though runs separately ticketed exhibitions throughout the year, as well. \n\n2. Explore Spitalfields Market. Since the 17th century, traders have been operating out of this East London market selling food, art, antiques, jewellery, and so much more. Today, the covered market is a hot destination for fashion and food enthusiasts with numerous stalls and shops open every day of the week. On the weekends, the market hosts various community events including pop-up music festivals. \n\n3. Shop at Westfield London. Located in West London, Westfield London is an enormous shopping centre hosting roughly 320 stores and restaurants spread over 2.5 million square feet, including the high-end retail sector named The Village. In addition to a wide selection of food and shopping, there are multiple activity options including miniature golf, rock climbing, and a cinema. \n\n4. Visit the Barbican Centre. The Barbican Centre is a large performing arts centre in the City of London nestled in the impressive Barbican Estate, which is an impressive example of Brutalist architecture. The centre is home to both the London Symphony Orchestra and the BBC Symphony Orchestra, in addition to hosting multiple theatre performances, film screenings, and additional concerts. The public are also welcome to enjoy its library, dine in one of its three restaurants, or explore its vast indoor conservatory. \n\n5. Explore the Battersea Power Station. The Grade-II listed Battersea Power Station, which sits on the south bank of the Thames just west of Westminster, was recently refurbished and reopened as a shopping and leisure destination. Inside the building, there are various shops, eateries, and bard including Control Room B: a cocktail bar nestled within the original dials and controls of the power station. If there's a break in the rainy weather, the riverfront of the power station is lined with additional food stalls, and Battersea Park is a short five-minute walk away down the bank of the Thames. If the rain stays all day, though, there are plenty of activities sheltered by the power station including miniature gold, ping pong, and a cinema. \n\nWhether it's rain or shine, London has an endless supply of activities, sights, and eateries to ensure you have an unforgettable trip.

    "user_input": "What other strange and obscure music genres can I check out?",
    "assistant_response": "Here are some more obscure music genres to listen to:\n\n1. The music genre known as pirate metal is a unique blend of heavy metal and sea shanties, accompanied by folk instruments like the concertina. Despite the unusual mix, bands such as Alestorm have found success in this genre and have a dedicated following.\n2. Math rock is an indie rock style that utilizes complex time signatures and unusual meters. The genre emerged in the 1980s and peaked in the mid-1990s. Today, similar techniques have been adapted to pop music, resulting in the creation of the genre known as \"math pop.\"\n3. Steven Roden created the minimalist ambient music genre called \"lowercase\" in 2001 by manipulating and amplifying sounds made from handling paper. The genre is characterized by its quiet and unobtrusive nature and gained attention following the release of the compilation album \"Lowercase-Sound\" in 2002. Roden's track \"Bell Is The Truth (Berlin)\" exemplifies the beauty of the genre, created by tapping light bulbs in total darkness to produce bell-like sounds.\n4. Witch House is a genre that doesn't have any resemblance to house music, despite the name. It was coined by Travis Egedy (aka, Pictureplane) and features slow tempo, chopped and screwed songs with elements of goth, shoegaze, hip-hop, drone, noise, and industrial. Other artists, such as Clams Casino, Holy Other, and Zola Jesus, have also incorporated Witch House elements into their music. Though the genre burned out after a few years, it remains captivating.\n5. Skweee is a genre of mostly instrumental music that originated in Sweden and Finland, combining synth leads and basslines with funk and soul rhythms. Its name reflects the idea of squeezing out the grooviest sound possible. Skweee was also a major influence on dubstep during 2008-2009.",

    "assistant_response": "When people hear the word \"pyramid,\" they often think of Egypt. However, the world's largest pyramid is in Cholula, Mexico. Tlachihualtepetl, also called the Great Pyramid of Cholula, is 217 feet (66 meters) tall and its base is 1,476 by 1,1476 feet (450 by 450 meters). Its total volume is 157 million cubic feet. Due to its size, it took centuries to build. It was worked on several different times between 300 BC and 700 AD. There was a temple above it to worship Quetzalcoatl - the Aztec god of learning and books. However, the temple was abandoned around the 8th or 9th century AD. Over time, it became covered with vegetation. As a result, it blended in and Spaniards first mistook it for a hill when they conquered Mexico in 1521. They replaced the temple with a church and the pyramid stayed hidden until the 1930s when the earth started to erode. Archeologists have excavated and studied many parts of the pyramid since then, including the altars. It has also become a tourist attraction since then. Thousands of people visit Tlachihualtepetl each year. ",

    "assistant_response": "Dear friend, \n\nSo much happened in my early solo career. In 1976, my primary source of income came from TV appearances. You remember those, like The Hollywood Squares, Donny & Marie, The Sonny and Cher Show, and The Brady Bunch Hour? But after I left Ike, I started getting sued for all these gigs that we'd had to cancel. I had to resume touring with United Artists just to pay off my debts, but thanks to Bob Mackie I came back sexier than ever in 77! My career really took off, from cabaret shows in Vegas to tours across the US and Australia.  \n\nRough, my third solo album, came out in 1978 and was distributed across the U.S. and Europe! And then there was my next album, Love Explosion, which was my exploration into disco. Unfortunately, neither of these performed very well, so I ended up leaving United Artists. I still got to headline another tour, at least.\n\nin 1979, I ran into an Australian manager named Roger Davies. After he saw me perform in San Francisco at the Fairmont Hotel, he agreed to be my manager! I was back in the international spotlight, working in Italy on Luna Park and touring in South Africa. That move of mine got a lot of flack, and to tell you the truth, I regret my naivety about the apartheid. \n\nFlash forward to October 1981, when Rod Stewart saw me perform in New York City and invited me to perform on Saturday Night Live with him. The next month, I opened for the Rolling Stones on their American Tour. Early the next year, I got to perform on the Willem Ruis show in the Netherlands, and my song \"Shame, Shame, Shame,\" ended up being a hit. My cover of \"Ball of Confusion\" (that I recorded for B.E.F.) was really popular in European dance clubs. I even got to film an MTV music video for that song. I was one of the first black American artists on the channel. I also got to appear on Chuck Berry's television special that year. The rest, as they say, is history!\n\nSincerely, \nTina Turner",

With these actionable steps, you'll be able to improve your Japanese language skills in no time. Here's what you need to do:\n\n1. Invest in quality study materials: It's important to have study materials that are tailored to your level and learning style. Look for books, audio, and video resources that will help you learn Japanese.\n\n2. Build a strong vocabulary: Learn at least 20-30 new words each day, and use them in your daily conversations and writing.\n\n3. Master basic grammar rules: Learn basic Japanese grammar rules, including sentence structure, particles, verb conjugations, and more. Use flashcards, grammar books, and other resources to practice.\n\n4. Use the right apps and resources: There are many Japanese language apps and resources available online, but not all of them are effective. Find the ones that work best for you, such as Duolingo, Lingodeer, or Rosetta Stone.\n\n5. Practice daily conversation: One of the best ways to improve your speaking skills is to engage in daily conversations. Use apps like HelloTalk to find native Japanese speakers to practice with.\n\n6. Watch Japanese TV shows and movies: Watching Japanese TV shows and movies can help you improve your listening and comprehension skills. Try to watch them without subtitles for an added challenge.\n\n7. Immerse yourself in the language: Finally, immerse yourself in Japanese culture as much as possible. Listen to Japanese music, read Japanese books, and practice speaking and writing as often as possible.\n\n8.

    "user_input": "Please summarize this post. Make it easier to read and much shorter. It should only be about a paragraph or two. Use the text following this request. \n\nAfter World War II, designating the start and end dates for daylight saving time fell to state governments. Because this created many railroad scheduling and safety problems, however, Congress passed the Uniform Time Act in 1966. This law set the nationwide dates of daylight saving time from the last Sunday in April until the last Sunday in October. In 2007, Congress amended the act to expand the period in which daylight saving time is in effect from the second Sunday in March to the first Sunday in November - dates that remain in effect today.\n\nThe Uniform Time Act allows states and territories to opt out of daylight saving time, however. Arizona and Hawaii are on permanent standard time, along with Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, Guam and American Samoa.\n\nNow, many other states are considering whether to stop falling back and springing ahead. Several U.S. states have legislation and resolutions under consideration to support permanent standard time, while many others have been or are considering permanent daylight saving time. Legislation and resolutions for permanent standard time have increased from 15% in 2021 to 31% in 2023.\n\nIn March 2022, the U.S. Senate passed the Sunshine Protection Act  in a bid to make daylight saving time permanent. But the House did not move forward with this legislation. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio reintroduced the bill on March 1, 2023.\n\nThe spike in activity among states seeking to break from these twice-yearly changes reflects how more people are recognizing the downsides of this practice. Now, it's up to legislators to decide whether we end the time shift altogether, and to choose permanent standard or daylight saving time.",
    "assistant_response": "After WWII, states were given the right to choose the start and end dates for daylight saving time, but this caused serious problems for rail schedules. To address this, Congress passed the Uniform Time Act in 1966 which standardized the changes, but still allowed states and territories to opt out entirely. Arizona, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and some U.S. territories decided to stay on permanent time. \n\nMany other states and legislators are considering abolishing daylight saving time, but no bill has passed. People are starting to recognize the problems caused by changing the time twice a year and want to move to a permanent standard time. ",

Their courage as they bounce from farm truck to semi-trailer to freight container, trading warm spring sunshine for cavernous metal walls is humbling. At one point in the story, I cried when the bag tore and the smallest potato fell to the ground during a transfer between trucks. My kids are long grown up, but my motherly heart broke. The other spuds could only watch in horror as they rolled away into a gutter. Their stoicism throughout the harrowing tale is a lesson in perseverance and bravery that people can only hope to achieve in their lifetimes.\n\nDon't buy this book if you're looking for tepid, feel-good reading, but do buy it if you want gentle humor and beautiful descriptions of love and tenderness from an unexpectedly feisty little family. I promise that sorrow is tempered with joy and the book is well worth a read. It gets all the stars from me!",

Can you help debug the function and explain how why it's not working as expected?\n\npublic static List checkForEvens(int [] nums) {\n    ArrayList anwer = new ArrayList<Integer>();\n    for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {\n    if(nums[i] / 2 == 0) {\n    answer.add(nums[i]\n     }  \n   }\n}",
    "assistant_response": "Certainly! The function 'checkForEvens' iterates through an array and if a number in the array is divisible by 2, then it gets added to 'answer' which is later returned.\n\nThe reason the function may not be returning the expected result is because of the if statement, 'if (nums[i] /2 == 0)'. The statement is looking for numbers that get divided by 2 in the array and equal 0, which doesn't align with what you expect the function to do. \n\nInstead, you want to use the modulo operator to check for the remainder of a number that is being divided by 2. If a number is divided by 2 and returns a remainder of 0, then we can assume that it's an even number. So, the small change of 'if (nums[i] % 2 == 0)' should solve your issue. \n\nI've rewritten the function below with the correction.\n\npublic static List checkForEvens(int [] nums) {\n    ArrayList anwer = new ArrayList<Integer>();\n    for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {\n    if(nums[i] % 2 == 0) {\n    answer.add(nums[i]\n     }  \n   }\n}",

Ambrose Straub further contributed to the product's popularity when he created a peanut-butter-making-machine which increased its viability as a mass market product.\n\nWhile many people falsely credit George Washington Carver with inventing peanut butter, many of his contributions did, in fact, pave the way for its invention.

People have a natural circadian rhythm that controls certain hormones. Waking up early will help you maintain your circadian rhythm.\n2. Drink water in the morning. Drinking water soon after you wake up will help keep you hydrated. Since low levels of dehydration are linked with fatigue and headaches, you should drink water when you first get up.\n3. Incorporate movement into your day. Human bodies were designed to move, yet many of your jobs are sedentary. You should incorporate movement into your day because exercise has tremendous health benefits.\n4. Go outside. Being outside will allow you to breathe some fresh air. The sunlight also provides vitamin D which your body needs. Deficiencies in vitamin D are linked to fatigue, low mood, and depression.\n5. Sit down to eat. Digestion occurs best when you are sitting down. \n6. Walking. Although walking is often overlooked as a healthy habit, it improves fitness, and heart health, and prevents gaining weight. Walking is also linked to improved posture and circulation.\n7. Cook for yourself. Cooking for yourself allows you to control what you are eating. Cooking is also a form of self-care that you can practice every day.\n8. Eat some vegetables. Eating vegetables is a healthy choice. By choosing to eat vegetables, you can reduce the number of unhealthy foods you eat.\n9. Limit your phone time. Studies have shown that the blue light emitted from phones leads to a reduction in melatonin which your body needs to regulate sleep. This can negatively affect your natural circadian rhythm.\n10. Do some cleaning. A messy physical space around you can affect your mood. Cleaning up can reduce frustration and make it easier to cook for yourself.\n11. Read something. Reading can stimulate growth, reduce stress, reduce age-related cognitive decline, and help you sleep at night.\n12. Get plenty of rest. It is recommended that you get at least 8 hours of sleep at night. Low-quality sleep and lack of sleep have been linked to several ailments. ",

    "assistant_response": "Good evening, I'm Rose Nylund, and welcome to our exciting live coverage of the MMA fight. \n\nIn the red corner, we have Dustin Poirier, who reminds me a bit of a young, strapping Bjorn Larson, the town blacksmith in St. Olaf. In the blue corner, we have the reigning champion, Conor McGregor, who reminds me of a dear friend of mine from St. Olaf, Olaf Olafson. He was a gentle giant, but when he got riled up, let me tell you, he was a force to be reckoned with!\n\nNow, I remember my great-grandfather, Olaf, was a boxer. He had an incredible right hook and used to knock out his opponents in the first round. One time, he was up against a fighter who was twice his size, but Olaf had a secret weapon - his lucky rabbit's foot. He rubbed it before every fight for luck, and it never failed him. Sure enough, in the third round, he landed a lucky punch and knocked out the giant. It was a St. Olaf miracle!\n\nOh, the fight has started and they are really going at it. It's hard to tell who has the upper hand. Wait, Poirier is throwing some powerful punches, but Mcgregor is dodging them like a St. Olaf resident dodges questions about lutefisk. Oh my, Poirier took down McGregor with a move that I can only describe as a \"hootenanny flipper.\" I remember once in St. Olaf, we had a hootenanny, and one of the guests tried to do a flip, but he ended up landing on the buffet table and knocking over all the pickled herring. It was a real mess, but it looks like McGregor is going to be okay.\n\nThe fight is getting intense now, and the crowd is getting into it. They're cheering and shouting like they're at a St. Olaf snowman-building contest. McGregor is gaining the upper hand. He's landed a few good blows, and Poirier is looking rough.\n\nOh, and there it is! McGregor landed a knockout blow, and the crowd is going wild! It's sure has been an exciting night, and I'm sure my great-grandfather Olaf would be proud of these two fighters. \n\nReporting live from the octagon, I'm Rose Nylund, reminding you to always keep your lucky rabbit's foot close at hand.",

Adelaide giggled and claimed: \"That's obviously because they don't weigh as much as us! We are just not made for cool stuff like that.\" \n\n\"That's not a very nice thing to say,\" replied their mother, who had been observing their antics for a while without intervention. \"Just because our bodies are not as lithe as the leopards, does not mean that we are less worthy. We have many other talents that the leopards wished they had.\" Mother Elephant, slowly making her way to her teary-eyed son, offered her trunk to him to help him back onto his feet. \"We have extreme strength that is almost unparalleled in the animal world! And our trunks are amazing designs of nature that allow us to do so many different tasks that other animals could not even dream about achieving!\" This statement from Mother Elephant made Adelaide take a closer look at her trunk, observing its great strength and prehensility. Fred, too, analyzed the muscles on his body and admired the force that was hiding behind his hide; his tears now almost dried. \n\nMother Elephant smiled at her children, aware of the potency of her words. \"We all have different strengths and weaknesses, and it is important not to feel discouraged about the latter. Just remember the things that make us unique!\" she said and gave the children a warm hug before the two twins rushed back into the bushland to compare their strength in a playful battle.",

The cartilage was so badly smashed that an emergency-room surgeon had to remove it all, leaving Eagleman with a rubbery proboscis that he could bend in any direction. But it stiffened up eventually, and it's hard to tell that it was ever injured. Eagleman has puckish, neatly carved features, with a lantern jaw and modish sideburns. In Baylor's lab-coated corridors, he wears designer jeans and square-toed ankle boots, and walks with a bounce in his step that's suspiciously close to a strut, like Pinocchio heading off to Pleasure Island.\n\nIf Eagleman's body bears no marks of his childhood accident, his mind has been deeply imprinted by it. He is a man obsessed by time. As the head of a lab at Baylor, Eagleman has spent the past decade tracing the neural and psychological circuitry of the brain's biological clocks. He has had the good fortune to arrive in his field at the same time as fMRI scanners, which allow neuroscientists to observe the brain at work, in the act of thinking. But his best results have often come through more inventive means: video games, optical illusions, physical challenges. Eagleman has a talent for testing the untestable, for taking seemingly sophomoric notions and using them to nail down the slippery stuff of consciousness. \"There are an infinite number of boring things to do in science,\" he told me. \"But we live these short life spans. Why not do the thing that's the coolest thing in the world to do?\"",

Schizophrenia is rare in younger children.\n\nSchizophrenia symptoms can differ from person to person, but they generally fall into three main categories: psychotic, negative, and cognitive.\n\nPsychotic symptoms include changes in the way a person thinks, acts, and experiences the world. People with psychotic symptoms may lose a shared sense of reality with others and experience the world in a distorted way. For some people, these symptoms come and go. For others, the symptoms become stable over time. Psychotic symptoms include:\n\nHallucinations: When a person sees, hears, smells, tastes, or feels things that are not actually there. Hearing voices is common for people with schizophrenia. People who hear voices may hear them for a long time before family or friends notice a problem.\nDelusions: When a person has strong beliefs that are not true and may seem irrational to others. For example, individuals experiencing delusions may believe that people on the radio and television are sending special messages that require a certain response, or they may believe that they are in danger or that others are trying to hurt them.\nThought disorder: When a person has ways of thinking that are unusual or illogical. People with thought disorder may have trouble organizing their thoughts and speech. Sometimes a person will stop talking in the middle of a thought, jump from topic to topic, or make up words that have no meaning.\nMovement disorder: When a person exhibits abnormal body movements. People with movement disorder may repeat certain motions over and over.\nNegative symptoms include loss of motivation, loss of interest or enjoyment in daily activities, withdrawal from social life, difficulty showing emotions, and difficulty functioning normally.\n\nNegative symptoms include:\n\nHaving trouble planning and sticking with activities, such as grocery shopping\nHaving trouble anticipating and feeling pleasure in everyday life\nTalking in a dull voice and showing limited facial expression\nAvoiding social interaction or interacting in socially awkward ways\nHaving very low energy and spending a lot of time in passive activities. In extreme cases, a person might stop moving or talking for a while, which is a rare condition called catatonia.\nThese symptoms are sometimes mistaken for symptoms of depression or other mental illnesses.\n\nCognitive symptoms include problems in attention, concentration, and memory. These symptoms can make it hard to follow a conversation, learn new things, or remember appointments. A person's level of cognitive functioning is one of the best predictors of their day-to-day functioning. Health care providers evaluate cognitive functioning using specific tests.\n\nCognitive symptoms include:\n\nHaving trouble processing information to make decisions\nHaving trouble using information immediately after learning it\nHaving trouble focusing or paying attention\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recognized that having certain mental disorders, including depression and schizophrenia, can make people more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19.

The trial turned out to be one of the most sensational cases of the 20th century in America. Approximately 1000 people and more than 100 newspapers packed inside the courtroom daily to watch the trial that only lasted eight days. In the end, the jury returned the verdict of guilty in less than nine minutes. John Scopes was fined $100. ",

Now imagine how satisfying that would be on a bigger scale. No, bigger than that. That's right, I'm talking about the Earth. Wouldn't it be great if there was a machine that could crack the earth just like an egg? I certainly believe so. That's why I made these plans here . . . *pulls up blueprints for an intricately designed machine* . . . for what I lovingly call the Crust Cracker 5000. Although these are blueprints right now, my team and I are hard at work on the prototype. Unfortunately, doomsday devices aren't cheap. That's why we need your help. We're asking for just $500 Million to help us fund this beautiful machine. \n\nNow, I'm no idiot. I'm sure everyone watching this video may be wondering, \"Dr. Disaster, why would I want to help fund the production of a machine that would crack the core of the Earth? I live there!\" You're right to have these thoughts. That's what makes you smart. That's what makes you human. Do you know what else comes with being human? Problems. And boy, are there a lot of them. I can say with 99% certainty that the Crust Cracker 5000 takes care of every single one. Taxes? Gone. Debt? Wiped. That annoying hangnail that you just can't get rid of right now without feeling like you're tearing off all the skin on your finger? Absolutely obliterated. Literally, any problem you can think of would be solved quickly and humanely with the Crust Cracker 5000. Except for death; but we all die eventually, so why suffer until then?\n\n*Dr. Disaster walks in front of a half-built machine with scientists in lab coats around it.* Now, you may be wondering what we will do with your hard-earned money. Where exactly does it go? Let me be the first to assure you that none of it goes into our pockets. We are purely a non-profit organization. Every cent we make is being put directly into the development of the Crust Cracker 5000. For example, let's take a look at this section of our prototype. In my demonstration, the action performed by this piece was done with a spoon. Think of this as a bigger spoon. Unfortunately, Crust Cracker 1 through Crust Cracker 4999 has failed at this point. We just can't get a spoon big enough to generate enough force to crack this planet open. With your money, we could get the tools we need to add to the existing Crust Cracker platform and really get to that good magma goo in the mantle. Again, I have been Dr. Disaster, and this is my crack . . . *Dr. Disaster winks* . . . team of scientists. Thank you so much for your time, and I hope you do consider donating to this wonderful cause.",

Do not give me content-based tips; I want them strictly to be about essay writing.",
    "assistant_response": "Here are five things you can focus on to improve your essay writing:\n\n1. Write a Strong Thesis: A thesis is an articulate statement of your central argument. Write your thesis sooner rather than later to focus your research and write around a central point without being distracted by tangential ideas.\n2. Create an Outline: Writing an outline fleshes out the core ideas in your essay, helping you to focus on each section and the relevant data/quotes when you write your rough draft. \n3. Use and Cite Outside Sources: Most college essays necessitate some level of research, and in order for your paper to be compelling, you will need to support your claims using quotes and, in some cases, statistics and data. Find a reputable source that provides helpful, relevant information that you can quote or incorporate to develop your writing. Just be certain to cite any sources you include, whether those sources are direct or indirect.\n4. Create a Rough Draft: A rough draft translates your outline into a structured essay with an introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion.\n5. Proofread: Proofreading is important even for the most accomplished writer. Review your paper carefully, both editorially and structurally. Correct grammar and punctuation as you go and make sure that the structure of your essay is cohesive, relevant, and compelling.",

With no host or hostess, I needed to find my own seating. This can be fine in certain establishments, but here the options were extremely limited given the size of the dining room. \n\nOnce seated, I spent upwards of thirty minutes waiting for service.

I grabbed something off of a table and brought it back to my seat, but it was impossible to cut through, and something stringy kept getting stuck in my teeth.

    "assistant_response": "Sure, look below at the largest marathons in the world you can run in as a member of the public. \n\n1. New York City Marathon\nNew York is a major city in the United States as well as the world. Its marathon is no different. Each year, the New York Marathon brings in up to 50,000 runners. The starting places are strictly regulated, however, and there is a split quota between New York residents, Americans, and anyone else. This means your chances are slim if you are not from New York or America, but you can purchase tickets with a tour company, which may be the best way for non-USA citizens to attend. The marathon is run around early November, and anyone over 18 is welcome to apply.\n\n2. Chicago\nStaying in America, the next marathon on the list is Chicago, which is in the state of Illinois. Regularly drawing 40,000 participants, the Chicago marathon is a great way to push yourself to the limit and see one of the United States' most populous cities. It is a bit easier to get a ticket for the Chicago marathon with no qualifying times and an entry age of just 16. The registration closes at a max of 45,000. The Chicago marathon takes place in mid-October.\n\n3. Paris\nThe city of love, Paris, is an incredible place full of sights, smells, and sounds. In early April, it is also the host of the third-largest marathon in the world. About 40,000 descend on France's capital to test themselves in the streets where Napoleon used to walk. Entry differs from the USA marathons, with participants needing a sports health certificate signed by a doctor. You can apply online or in writing; the minimum age is 18.\n\n4. London\nA historical city like no other, London hosts one of the most sought-after marathons in mid-April each year and boasts around 35,000 crossing the finish line each year. Any foreigners will struggle to get a starting place for this famous race, with 7% as the reported number for how many foreigners finish each year. The best and easiest way to get a ticket for the London marathon is to purchase one through a travel agent.\n\n5. Berlin\nWhere better to run 26.2 miles than the German capital of Berlin? Take in the war monuments seemingly on every corner while you compete with a limited 40,000 people to get around Berlin the most quickly. As with the London marathon, the best way to get a ticket for the Berlin marathon is through a travel agent or charity provider.",

And an additional $20 billion appropriation for COVID-19 relief will also provide help for some of the most immediate challenges.\n\nBut even with this aid, there is still a funding gap. The National Indian Health Board, a nonprofit advocacy group representing federally recognized tribes, recommends a commitment of $48 billion for the 2024 fiscal year to fully fund the health needs of Indigenous people. The current budget, $9.3 billion, is less than one-fifth of that.\n\nThe recent increases in funding are certainly a step in the right direction. But the factors contributing to the shorter lives of Native Americans started generations ago, and they are still reverberating among the youngest of us today.\n\nBoth from a professional standpoint - as well as one that is very personal to me and my ancestors - more work in this area cannot come soon enough.",

Its construction was a result of efforts to control floods and provide water for irrigation to transform the American Southwest from an arid region into fertile cropland. Also, it was seen as a suitable solution for the water needs of the Los Angeles region and Southern California. Construction began in 1930, it was dedicated in 1935, and hydroelectric generators went online in 1937. The dam was built for $49 million then, and the power plant and generators cost an additional $71 million.

It was very nice to be carried inside, given a nice cool bath, and set aside for the night to sleep and relax.\n\nI woke up a bit later than usual still surrounded in the colander by my other cucumber friends. They were still sleeping so I did my best not to disturb them. They weren't a talkative bunch normally anyway. The sun was just starting to peak in through the curtains above the sink when a lady entered the room. The same lady who grabbed me from the patch yesterday. She seemed very friendly and nice.\n\nAt least I thought so until she picked me up, bowl and all, and gave me a big shake. What a way to rise and shine. I could hear the other cucumbers grumbling too. She transported us a few feet away to another part of the countertop. Then, the lady mixed a bunch of ingredients in a big pot on the stove and it started to smell good but it also tickled my nose a bit. Perhaps a bit too garlicky for my tastes. \n\nNext thing I knew she was picking me up again but this time she stuck me in a jar! I couldn't believe it, it was finally happening! It's the most exciting day in any gherkins life. A few of my other cucumber friends joined me and we all nestled up close to each other. It was very cozy and everyone had a nice view through the glass too.\n\nThen, the nice lady gave us a warm bath. It felt even nicer than the cool bath I had before. It had hints of dill and pepper and it covered me from my tippy toes all the way to the top of my head. She put a nice little roof over top sealing me in.

    "user_input": "Reduce this article from 488 to less than 150 words by summarizing and focusing on the essential facts.\n\nIn this fact sheet, students will learn about the people who became actors, what an average day was like and more.\n\nActors\n\nThe life of an actor changed dramatically during Shakespeare's lifetime. At first actors toured in companies, travelling the country to perform in towns and cities and in private homes. By the time Shakespeare died, London had several permanent theatres where the actors performed, drawing in huge audiences. Yet, despite the popularity of play-going, the acting profession had a bad reputation. Actors were seen as unruly and a threat to a peaceful society.\n\nWho became an actor?\n\nIn Shakespeare's time acting was a profession only open to boys and men. Women were acting elsewhere in Europe but they were not allowed to perform in public theatres in England until 1660. In an Elizabethan production boys would play the female parts, like Ophelia in Hamlet or Desdemona in Othello, whilst occasionally men would play the older women. There were many more actors working across the country at the time, but these are some of the best known Elizabethan actors: Richard Burbage, Edward Alleyn, Robert Armin, William Kemp and Nathan Field.\n\nWhat was an actor's training?\n\nMany actors began their careers as young boys. They could join a company as an apprentice and be taught by one of the more senior actors within the company. Actors were expected to be able to sword fight, sing and dance, as well as having a good memory for learning lines.\n\nHow big was a company?\n\nCompany sizes varied, depending on where the company was working and how wealthy the company was. A wealthy company, when working in a theatre, might have 8- 12 senior members called sharers, 3-4 boys, a number of hired players (hired men) and then stage hands, tiremen (who would help the actors dress back stage) and some musicians. Actors would join a company under the patronage of a monarch (like the Queen's Men) or a nobleman, such as the Lord Admiral's Men or the Lord Chamberlain's Men. \n\nWhere did a company work?\n\nMost companies were based in London, using one of the permanent theatres. Sometimes the theatres were closed, for example when there was a plague in the city, and so companies would then go on tour. Mostly they toured England, but companies did also go abroad, particularly to the Netherlands and Germany.\n\nWhat did an actor earn?\n\nMany theatre companies operated a shareholder system. Sharers in a company earned more than the hired men. Shakespeare was a sharer of the Chamberlain's Men, later the King's Men, and so shared the costs and also the profits the company made. Actors' earnings also depended on where the company was playing. The company made more money in London than in the country, so could pay actors higher wages. In 1597 the actor William Kendall was paid 10 shillings a week in London but only 5 shillings in the country.\n\n",
    "assistant_response": "Before Shakespeare's lifetime, actors, who were only men or boys, toured in companies. By the time of Shakespeare's death, Actors, though seen as having bad reputations, performed at several permanent playhouses in London. In Elizabethan productions, the roles of females were played by boys and occasionally, when an older female was required, by men. Boys often started their careers in their youth by becoming an apprentice. Older actors would teach them sword fighting, singing, and dancing. Among the most famous Elizabethan actors were Richard Burbage, Edward Alleyn, Robert Armin, William Kemp, and Nathan Field. In a wealthy company under the patronage of a monarch or nobleman, a senior actor - of which there were 8-12 - could earn as much as 10 shillings a week for performances in London.",

Keeping a plant healthy reduces the risk of pest infestations. \n\nUse the following passage to answer the question.\n\nHow to Treat Yellowing Leaves on Snake Plant\nOnce you narrow down the reason your snake plant has yellow leaves, you'll want to address the issue quickly to keep your plant healthy. However, yellow leaves won't turn green again even if the issue is remedied, so it's best to cut them off with sharp, sanitized pruners or scissors at the base of the plant.\n\nCheck your plant's soil moisture. If the soil feels soggy and you've been watering frequently, overwatering could be to blame. Let the soil dry out completely before watering again. In extreme cases, you may need to repot the plant in fresh soil and inspect the roots for signs of rot.\n\nIf your snake plant's leaves look sunburned and the plant is getting direct sunlight, move it further away from the light source or use a sheer curtain to filter the light and make it less intense. Address inconsistent temperature by keeping the plant away from drafty areas and putting it in a space with a more consistent temperature.\n\nInspect your snake plant regularly for signs of pests. Remove insects with blasts of water or a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol, then use neem oil or horticultural soap to prevent them from coming back. Keep your plant healthy going forward to lessen the likelihood that pests will attack.\n\nIf you haven't fertilized or refreshed your snake plant's soil in a few years and other causes don't apply, repot it with fresh soil. If the plant seems potbound, use a pot one size larger or divide the plant and repot it in its original container. If you suspect overfertilizing is the issue, flush your plant's soil several times with water to remove excess nutrients. Going forward, only fertilize your snake plant twice per year in spring and summer.",

I remember when they came into the league. They were originally called the Devil Rays. They were absolutely awful back then. They were the laughingstock of baseball. Their roster was full of has-beens and never will be's, and occasionally a future Hall of Famer looking for a final paycheck. They were notably bad, even for a young franchise.\n\nEventually, even our mascot became reviled, with some folks saying that the Devil himself was cursing our franchise. As a result, they rebranded to simply be the Tampa Bay Rays, trying to invoke the image of a sunbeam. They improved, against all odds. They never made the playoffs from 1998-2007 and then made the playoffs seven times from 2008-2021. They even made the World Series twice. But of course, they lost. Because that's what the Rays do. They give you just enough hope, only to break your heart again. Some folks will say that's just baseball. But it doesn't make it any less unfair for the rest of us. ",

People are in a hurry, living their lives, rushing from work to appointments to pick up their children from school, etc., and they may not have a lot of time to talk to you.\n\nAnd if you have a sense of humor and don't take yourself too seriously, the whole country will teach you French.  Allow people to correct you, and don't worry if they don't act extremely enthusiastic about your presence - French people can be more reserved in the North.  If you go down South, you may find people somewhat more gregarious.  If you want to blend in a bit, dress somewhat conservatively and wear comfortable shoes.

I don't know what that is, but it isn't pizza.\"\n\n\"How about this, let's fly out of here to your favorite spot and you grab two slices in your style. Then we'll fly to mine, and you give the broccoli a chance.\"\n\nBatman put his hand to his chin and pondered the request. But before he could reply, an alarm sounded in the halls.  Superman, noticing Batman's flummoxed expression, gave him a nod and then they both ran down the corridor to the security room.\n\nReaching the bank of computers and monitors, they could see a new report of an explosion in Mumbai of a potentially alien origin.\n\nSuperman looked at Batman and said, \"Well, there's no pizza in Mumbai but you better believe we're getting a slice when we're done.\"\n\n\"You got it,\" Batman replied, \"Let's suit up and save the day.\"\n",

The duel was, therefore, set for nine o'clock. Neither Hannah nor Lizzie slept that night, but each was quietly sure she would win. Hannah had been practicing calling Vanilla to her for weeks, and Vanilla was pretty good at it now. She knew that when Lizzie had had the puppy, it was too young to train - Vanilla couldn't possibly go to Lizzie. But Vanilla could sometimes be naughty. Could she be sure? \n\nAt the corner shop, Hannah bought a pouch of aniseed balls and put them in her pocket where the smell would surely be carried on her hands: dogs were supposed to find aniseed irresistible. 'I did want some anyway,' Hannah told herself. But it wasn't true - she would never have bought aniseed balls for herself. Hannah was really cheating. \n\nLizzie wished she hadn't agreed to a duel, but she couldn't get out of it now. She let Hannah take Fudge - her name for the puppy - home that night because she reckoned that Fudge would rush to greet her and not go to Hannah. But she had no qualms about putting a piece of raw steak in her pocket. It felt horrible, and she knew she would get into trouble with Bella over it. Well, too bad; this was an emergency. \n\nHannah had written out the rules carefully on a bit of paper. She read them out in her thin, clear voice. One or two people stopped to watch, but when some children ran into the dueling area, Bella shoed them away. The two girls would stand forty paces apart, with Bella in the middle holding the puppy. Then, when they were ready, Bella would give the signal and let go. Neither Lizzie nor Hannah was allowed to move, but they would each call the puppy's name. Whichever of them she ran to would be the winner and the puppy's owner. Bella was the judge, and her decision was final. \n\n'Twenty paces, then,' said Hannah. They counted out the steps and turned to face each other. Bella looked at both the girls to check they were ready. First one, and then the other nodded. 'Now!' Bella said and let go.",

The wind danced over his bald head, and tussled his limp and greasy hair.\n\nNigel was in a fantastic mood today. He felt truly alive for the first time in 40 years. As an accountant, there wasn't a huge amount of variation or interest in his work. Numbers came in, and these days robots did all the work. Never mind, Nigel kept walking. \n\nHe recalled better times when his hair had been thicker and his belly tighter. He was the master of the calculator, a colossal computer that sang machine rhythm for him and him alone. \n\nIn a way, Nigel reflected, he had been the architect of his own downfall. He made a machine that made him redundant. It doesn't even make him rich. But that's Luddite nonsense. If you're a plow maker, making a plow-making machine doesn't make you redundant, it makes your job more ... future-y. \n\nThe road bent and he could see the long straight of the beach up ahead. Long straight gravel road. Long straight horizon. He smelled the salty sea air. \n\nHe managed to get to the little place after Marg passed. She had never wanted to live at the beach, and that was fair. It is inconvenient to be so far from the semblance of civilization, but there it was. The sea. \n\nThe sea called to Nigel. When he was young, it had called him away to America. When he was finished getting his fancy degrees, it called him home. Now the sea called to him again, so Nigel kept walking.  \n\nThe crunch of gravel gave way to the soft pushing of buffalo grass, then the squish-crunch of sand. The bay embraced him in a grey arc, bounded on both ends by tall, withering cliffs. \n\nNigel walked a little further and felt his loafers dampen with the salt water. Soon he felt his knees and skin prickle with the lapping water. Then his cardigan got wet. Then his grizzled chin and his lank hair became the playthings of the sea. \n\nNigel kept walking. ",

Alice worked with scientists and engineers to build a giant machine that would protect the United States from the hurricane.\n\nThe day of the hurricane arrived, and Alice's machine was ready.

Alice was proud of what she had done, and she knew that she would continue to use her intelligence to help others.\n\nAlice's story is a reminder that even the smallest person can make a big difference. Alice was just a 10-year-old girl, but she was able to save the United States from a natural disaster.

Make a rope from a vine and swing across, Tarzan style: The player could command the character to make a rope from a vine and swing across. This would not be viable if there are no vines, or if the vines are not strong enough to support the weight of the character. \n2. Make a running jump: The most straightforward option, the character could run as fast as possible and attempt to leap across the chasm. However, they may not be able to clear the gap, falling down the chasm to their peril. They could also simply trip some distance before the chasm. This may be useful if you do not wish to incur a \"game over\" screen for this rash decision by the player.\n3. Lay a log across the chasm: The player could command the character to look for a suitably long log to balance across the chasm. Alternatively, they could attempt to chop down a tree over the chasm. This would not work if the tree was of insignificant length to cover the gap or if the character was not strong enough to lift up and drop a sufficiently long log. \n4. Look for a way around: The player could command the character to simply walk along the chasm until they find a way across. This could fail if there is no way across, or if the path across is visible but not accessible. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as a rapidly moving river or a significant elevation difference. \n5. Acquire a vehicle: The player could command the character to look for a vehicle. This would not be a successful solution if they failed to find a vehicle capable of crossing the chasm or if the vehicle that they found was not in working order. However, a wrecked vehicle could serve as a useful clue or source of materials for the actual solution to this puzzle.\n\nCan I assist you in any other way with your text adventure? ",

Unlike TAI, which is purely atomic in nature, UTC is closely aligned with mean solar time (a modern replacement for Greenwich Mean Time) and accounts for variations in Earth's rotational speed by occasionally introducing \"leap seconds\". While TAI ticks away uniformly, the Earth's rotation gradually slows down over time. This means that UTC, which is pegged to the Earth's rotation, occasionally falls out of sync with TAI. To correct this, a \"leap second\" is added to UTC approximately every 18 months, although the exact timing is determined by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS). ",

    "assistant_response": "Here are three places in Nova Scotia where you should easily find gemstones and minerals:\n\n1. Amethyst Cove, between Cape Split and Cape Blomidon has been a source of amethysts for centuries. Care must be taken because of the extreme change in tides throughout the day. To reach Amethyst Cove, it's recommended to go by boat because the alternative option is to climb down an extremely hazardous path. The minerals that can be found at Amethyst Cove include hematite, calcite, agate, celadonite, native copper,  quartz, and malachite. \n2. Scotch Lake Quarry is located in Cape Breton County and continues to supply minerals such as pyrite, calcite, tremolite, pyroaurite, serpentine, dolomite, and graphite. The quarry was carved out of the Boisdale Hills, part of the Canadian Appalachians, and can be easily accessed from the main road.\n3. Brier Island, is an island in the Bay of Fundy. It is easily reached from the mainland by ferry. Just by walking along the beaches on the island, you can find zeolite, agate, jasper, and amethyst.",

    "user_input": "How is gold utilized in different sectors?",
    "assistant_response": "1. Jewelry: Gold's exceptional lustre and resistance to tarnish due to its inert nature have rendered it a preferred choice for crafting jewelry for millennia. Over half of the gold consumed today is converted into jewelry. Gold is both ductile and malleable, which enables it to be shaped into intricate designs that retain their form and beauty over substantial periods. Its chemical inertness ensures it remains unaffected by most chemicals, thereby preserving its aesthetic appeal even after prolonged use.\n2. Investment: Gold serves as a tangible asset that conserves its value over time, making it a popular choice as a financial hedge against inflation and currency instability. This is in part due to its limited availability - the cumulative quantity of gold mined throughout human history would fill merely about three Olympic-sized swimming pools. Gold's easy storability and globally recognized value also make it a sought-after asset during times of economic instability.\n3. Electronics: With its superior electrical conductivity and high resistance to corrosion and tarnish, gold plays an invaluable role in electronics, accounting for approximately 10% of global gold use. Gold is integral to a variety of electronic devices, encompassing smartphones, GPS units, televisions, and computers. In these applications, gold is typically employed in connectors, switch and relay contacts, soldered joints, and bonding wires.",

    "assistant_response": "Shanna was a librarian that loved her job and the small town she lived in. What she loved most about her life, though, was her cat, Fritz. Fritz would lie around the house sunbathing while Shanna was at work, or so she thought. Fritz was actually a cat with superpowers and he went around saving people all day long. \nEven while saving countless others, Fritz would inconspicuously save Shanna, too, whenever she would have accidents. Sometimes Fritz felt like that alone was a full-time job. \n\nSince Fritz would do this all day, he got the attention of Drakken, a huge Rottweiler living in the same neighborhood who didn't seem to care for the attention Fritz was getting from everyone, including his family. Drakken knew he had to put a stop to Fritz's heroic activities. He devised a plan to take down Fritz and recruited a few other dogs in the process.\n \nTensions grew heated as Drakken and his cohorts did everything in their power to sabotage Fritz time and time again. Finally, Fritz caught on and tempers quickly erupted. A huge fight broke out which ultimately ended with the defeat of Drakken. Afterward, Fritz realized that inside this mean, ferocious dog was an insecure puppy that just wanted attention and love. \n\nFritz took mercy on Drakken and helped him to see things in a different light. Drakken then trotted off to spend time with his family and everything returned to normal. ",

    "user_input": "I just moved to a new city and want to make some friends. I'm open to most things, but I especially love outdoor activities. Please don't suggest anything involving church groups as I am not religious. Generate a list of five ideas and make sure that you describe each one so that I can get a sense of whether or not I'd be open to trying it. ",
    "assistant_response": "Here are five things you can try to help you make friends in a new city. These ideas take into account your openness to most things, your love of outdoor activities, and the fact that you aren't religious. Each idea includes a description so that you can better understand whether or not you'd be open to it: \n\n1. Sports Leagues. Given your interest in being active outdoors, consider joining a recreational sports league. Search online or ask around at your workplace or gym to see what leagues are available to join. Pick a sport you think you might enjoy and choose a league that is appropriate for your anticipated skill level. Joining a sports league is a great way to get outside, engage in friendly competition, and most importantly, meet new people. \n2. Volunteering. Pretty much every city should have volunteer organizations where you can donate your time. Volunteering is not only a great way to give back and help those in need, but it's also a perfect way to connect with other volunteers and bond over your shared commitment to helping others. Make sure to look for a volunteer opportunity that suits your schedule, isn't too far from where you live, and is something that you will ultimately find fulfilling. Also, consider an opportunity that allows you to spend the majority of your time outside given your love of outdoor activities. \n3. Book Club. If you are someone who enjoys reading and discussing what you're reading with others, consider joining a book club. Book clubs are often organized monthly and involve meeting as a group to discuss a particular book that's been designated for that month. Not only will you get to read and talk about an interesting selection of new books, but joining a book club is a perfect way to expand your social circle and get to know a large group of people who share your interest. \n4. Running Groups. As someone who enjoys outdoor activities, you may want to consider joining an organized running group. A common practice in such groups is to go on fun runs that take place in different places around the city. It may not seem like you can easily get to know people by running with them, but rest assured that there is usually socialization at a restaurant, cafe, or brewery before or after the run, which makes it a great opportunity to get to know new people.\n5. Trivia Nights. It's extremely common for bars to host trivia nights on specific nights of the week in order to provide a fun group activity for their customers. Make sure to look for one that's geared toward matching up strangers instead of expecting people to come in their own groups.   \n\nI hope that you are able to utilize these suggestions to make some new friends in your city. Good luck! ",

When Emily was done, she sat back and stared hard at the scrap bit of paper in front of her. Time ticked away on her wall clock and she stared hard.\n\nWhen a whole minute had passed and nothing happened, Emily was ready to give up and put her things away. And then the paper rustled. So slowly, subtly - she wouldn't have noticed if she wasn't watching so carefully. It fluttered again and then all at once the paper scrunched up. Emily jerked back in her rickety, old chair, her eyes wide, and watched the paper twist and crumple and suddenly it burst up into the air, whizzing around. \n\nEmily let out a cry of delight, watching as a hummingbird slowly came into being, turning from a crumpled-up paper ball into a real hummingbird. Her face was split out in a wide smile as the beautiful, green and blue bird slowly came to land on her shoulder. The bird gently nuzzled her cheek before hopping away to peek curiously at her face. \n\nEmily pets the hummingbird carefully, taking note of how real and warm it felt with her fingers. With her pen held tighter in her hand, she turned to her notepad and considered what to draw next.",
